# How to contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing code to this project! See below for some loose guidelines as to how to contribute to this codebase.

## Submitting changes

Some general guidelines as to how to contribute code to this codebase:

* Always write clear log messages for your commits. One-line messages are cool for small changes, but don't be afraid to submit multi-line commit messages with more detail
* Where possible, code changes in commits should be backed up by one or more passing unit tests
* To submit code into the codebase, create a pull request containing the work you want to submit and (if necessary) request a review
* Where possible, only include related changes within a single pull request. Smaller, more frequent PR's are preferred over large infrequent contributions
* Don't raise a pull request for something that you wouldn't be happy being deployed into the live environment
* Where possible, link to the issue in the issue tracker that the PR relates to
* Pull requests should be submitted with a clear description of the work

## Code style

Currently we don't enforce a particular code style but that may change as the codebase grows larger. Just be sensible and prefer readability over something that's smart/faster/clever but totally illegible, unless you have a really good reason.
